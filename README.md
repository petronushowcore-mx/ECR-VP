# ECR-VP
Reference protocol for non-causal verification of architectural coherence, boundaries, and realizability in complex document corpora.
# ECR-VP — Epistemic Coherence Review & Verification Protocol

ECR-VP is a reference protocol for non-causal verification of structural
coherence, boundary clarity, and engineering realizability of complex
architectural document corpora.

The protocol is not a method for evaluating the quality of ideas,
not a ranking system, and not a validation framework based on metrics.
It explicitly excludes scoring, optimization, learning from results,
and consensus-seeking mechanisms.

ECR-VP treats independent interpreters (e.g. language models in clean
sessions) as non-causal observers whose role is to reveal invariants,
divergences, gaps, and risks of misinterpretation within a fixed corpus.
Final synthesis and canon protection are performed by a human author or editor.

The protocol is intended to operate upstream of engineering implementation,
grant applications, and academic or industrial review processes, serving
as a semantic stabilization and orientation layer rather than an evaluation
or certification mechanism.
